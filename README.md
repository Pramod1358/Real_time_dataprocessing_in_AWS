This project presents a scalable, real-time data processing framework that integrates Amazon Kinesis Data Streams with AWS Lambda to efficiently handle and store streaming data in Amazon S3. The architecture is designed to ingest user-generated input provided via Amazon Cognito, enabling secure and authenticated data flow into the Kinesis stream.
Upon receiving data through the Kinesis stream, AWS Lambda functions are triggered to process the data in real timeâ€”performing transformations, validations, or enrichment as needed. The processed data is then stored in Amazon S3 for persistent and cost-effective storage, making it readily available for downstream analytics.
To provide insights and visualization, the stored data is analyzed using Amazon QuickSight, enabling interactive dashboards and reports. This integration supports near real-time business intelligence, facilitating data-driven decisions with minimal latency.
The solution showcases how to build an event-driven, serverless architecture capable of handling high-throughput data pipelines, while ensuring scalability, security, and extensibility. It highlights the seamless integration of AWS services to support end-to-end data workflows, from data ingestion to analytics, making it well-suited for modern data processing use cases such as IoT telemetry, application logs, or user activity tracking.
Overall, the project demonstrates how to implement a robust real-time data pipeline using AWS-native services, aligning with best practices for data security, scalability, and cloud-native analytics.
